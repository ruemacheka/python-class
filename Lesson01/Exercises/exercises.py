# In-Class Exercises

# 1. Define and Print Variables
# Define two variables, string and num, and assign them proper values.
# Print a sentence containing the two variables.


# 2. User Input and Data Conversion
# Take two numbers as input from the user.
# Convert the numbers to integers and print their sum.


# 3. Identify Data Types
# Define variables of different data types (int, float, string, boolean).
# Print the data types of the variables.


# 4. Perform Arithmetic Operations
# Take two numbers as input from the user.
# Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus operations on the numbers.


# 5. Conditional Logic
# Take a number as input from the user.
# If the number is positive, print "Positive".

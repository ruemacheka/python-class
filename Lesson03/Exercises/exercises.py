Lesson 3 In-Class Exercises: Expanding on Classes, Objects, and Modules
=========================================================================
These exercises will help you practice and expand your understanding of 
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts and modular programming in Python.
"""

# Exercise 1: Creating a Class with Methods
# ------------------------------------------
# Define a `Book` class with attributes: title, author, and year.
# Implement a method `book_info` that returns the book details as a string.
# Create multiple instances and print their information.

# TODO: Define the Book class and implement the required method


# Exercise 2: Class Inheritance
# ------------------------------
# Define a `Person` class with attributes: name and age.
# Create a `Student` subclass that inherits from `Person` and adds a student_id attribute.
# Override a method `get_info` to include student_id.

# TODO: Define the Person class and the Student subclass


# Exercise 3: Encapsulation and Data Protection
# ---------------------------------------------
# Define a `BankAccount` class with private attributes: `__balance`.
# Implement deposit and withdraw methods with checks to prevent negative balance.
# Provide a method `get_balance` to safely retrieve the balance.

# TODO: Define the BankAccount class with encapsulation


# Exercise 4: Working with Modules
# ----------------------------------
# Create a module named `math_operations.py` containing functions `add(a, b)`, `subtract(a, b)`, `multiply(a, b)`, `divide(a, b)`.
# Import the module in another script and use its functions.

# TODO: Create the math_operations module and use its functions


# Exercise 5: Using Packages
# ---------------------------
# Create a package `geometry` with two modules `circle.py` and `rectangle.py`.
# `circle.py` should contain functions to calculate area and circumference.
# `rectangle.py` should contain functions to calculate area and perimeter.
# Import these modules and use them in another script.

# TODO: Define the package structure and implement the required modules


# Exercise 6: Polymorphism in Action
# -----------------------------------
# Create a base class `Shape` with a method `area()` that returns 0.
# Create two subclasses `Circle` and `Rectangle` that override `area()`.
# Demonstrate polymorphism by calling `area()` on different shape objects.

# TODO: Define the Shape class and its subclasses implementing polymorphism
